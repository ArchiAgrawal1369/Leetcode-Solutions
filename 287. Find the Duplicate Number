//Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
//There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.
//You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.


int i;
auto copy=nums;
sort(copy.begin(), copy.end());
for(i=0;i<copy.size()-1;i++)
       if (copy[i]==copy[i+1])
               break;
return copy[i];
